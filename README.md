_This project was created for module 4 of the EdX Skills for Life Front End Development bootcamp. In this challenge, we were tasked with calculating some finances in the console log from a 2-dimensional array._


# Console Finances

## Description

If you open the console log in browser, it pulls out information from an array contained in index.js. This page was created to learn more about JavaScript. All data is fictional. 

I found this challenge to be the hardest so far but it has definitely been rewarding to get to grips with JS logic. 

**Here is the published website URL:** https://seandonnelly92.github.io/Finance-Dashboard/

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
