_This project was created for module 4 of the EdX Skills for Life Front End Development bootcamp. In this challenge, we were tasked with calculating some finances in the console log from a 2-dimensional array._


# Console Finances

## Description

If you open the console log in browser, it pulls out information from an array contained in index.js. This page was created to learn more about JavaScript. All data is fictional. 

I found this challenge to be the hardest so far but it has definitely been rewarding to get to grips with JS logic. 

**Here is the published website URL:** https://seandonnelly92.github.io/Console-Finances/


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

Functionality is limited on the website, it mostly just displays information. The nav bar does contain five links: one is the logo which just redirects to the homepage. This will only be useful in future if other pages are added and the nav bar is updated. The other four links in the nav bar are internal anchor tags that scroll the relevant section on the homepage. 

Here is a screenshot of the live website:
